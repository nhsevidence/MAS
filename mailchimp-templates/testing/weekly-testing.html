                                            duration of follow-up. However, the

                                            study limitations. The study
                                            population was Caucasian, therefore
                                            validation of the results for other
                                            ethnic groups is needed. Also, the
                                            study did not allocate participants
                                            to specific antihypertensive
                                            medication therapeutic classes or
                                            set medication within each class as
                                            treatment was chosen by each
                                            participating clinician. For
                                            diuretics for instance, at the end
                                            of the study, there were more
                                            participants taking them in the upon
                                            waking group (46.5%) compared with

                                            (39.5%, p&lt;0.001). Finally, the
                                            method by which adverse events were
                                            assessed is open to recall bias.

                                            This large prospective trial aimed
                                            to answer a simple question directly
                                            relevant to general practice where
                                            there is a lack of good quality
                                            evidence. This new evidence suggests
                                            that taking the total daily dose of
                                            antihypertensive medication at
                                            bedtime, compared with in the
                                            morning, reduces cardiovascular
                                            events and mortality over a mean of
                                            6.3&nbsp;years. A major clinically
                                            significant result - but there are
                                            caveats.
                                          </p>

                                            The study included a non-UK
                                            (Spanish), Caucasian population and
                                            therefore, the findings may not
                                            apply to other populations with
                                            different sleeping patterns
                                            (although participants were
                                            encouraged not to sleep in the day)
                                            or people with different family
                                            origins. The mean age of the cohort
                                            was 60.5 years and therefore results
                                            may not apply to older cohorts.

                                            As is common in many trials of
                                            antihypertensive therapy, patient
                                            centred adverse events were poorly
                                            reported (sleep disturbance due to
                                            nocturia, falls and dizzy episodes
                                            due to postural hypotension). These
                                            were only collated via spontaneous
                                            reports which relies on people
                                            remembering to report such events.
                                            Assessing this by active questioning
                                            would have been preferable.

                                            The classes of drugs prescribed were
                                            not blinded and there were
                                            differences between the 2&nbsp;study
                                            groups with those who took a morning
                                            dose more likely to be on diuretics
                                            and beta-blockers.

                                            Broadly the clinicians appeared to
                                            prescribe classes of drugs in the
                                            manner of the NICE guidance but the
                                            criteria for diagnosing hypertension
                                            differed by using not only
                                            ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
                                            whilst awake but also allowed
                                            recruitment of those with raised
                                            blood pressure diagnosed using
                                            ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
                                            whilst asleep. The monitoring period
                                            for ambulatory blood pressure in the
                                            study was also 48 hours.

                                            The NICE guidance makes no
                                            recommendation as to when to take
                                            antihypertensive medication and it
                                            was a question that the development
                                            group did not consider.

                                            In conclusion, and despite the
                                            limitations discussed above, there
                                            may be a potential health gain in
                                            switching to a regimen of taking a
                                            total daily dose of antihypertensive
                                            medication at bedtime. This seems
                                            reasonable to do but we should be
                                            cautious if considering this in
                                            older people, in those at risk of
                                            falls and in those in whom such a
                                            change may reduce concordance with
                                            medication (for example, those
                                            taking antihypertensives which may
                                            not be suitable for bedtime
                                            administration such as diuretics).
