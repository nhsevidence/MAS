  <ShortSummary>RCT (n=1,312) found that among adults with type 2 diabetes, supplementation with vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acids, compared with placebo, resulted in no significant difference in change in eGFR at 5 years.</ShortSummary>
  <Comment>&lt;p&gt;A&amp;nbsp;related editorial discusses this research and details previous epidemiological studies that suggest improved outcomes with vitamin D supplementation in various clinical scenarios. It states that contrasting the results of this study and its predecessor vitamin D trials with the impressive body of epidemiological research that implicated vitamin D deficiency in various adverse health outcomes offers a stark lesson on the chasm between association and causation. Editorial authors highlight that it now seems safe to conclude that many prior epidemiological associations between vitamin D deficiency and adverse health outcomes were driven by unmeasured residual confounding or reverse causality.&lt;/p&gt;</Comment>
